# Manager - React Native Application to manage employees.


This is a basic app I created to practise React-Native and Redux.


The app uses react-native-router-flux for smooth navigation in the app. 

For login I use firebase, the credentials for which will be hidden. Reusable components like Input and Button are 
being used to make it better and more customizable, so if anyone wants to use them in their projects they are 
most welcome.


## All thanks to @Stephen Grider for his amazing course on React-Native on Udemy.
